# **Plant CYPome Explorer (CYPomeExplorer)**

A comparative computational framework for functional mapping and substrate triage across plant cytochrome P450s (CYPs), designed for synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and protein engineering workflows where sequence-identity nomenclature is insufficient to predict substrate specificity and regioselectivity. The core functional descriptor is binding site vectors (BSVs): a high-resolution representation of pocket shape and electrostatics defined by spherical rays cast from a binding-site center to the first intersected atomic surface, recording both vector length and partial charge.

What this repo aims to do

BSV-based functional landscape mapping of a plant CYP set (the “CYPome”) using either static structures or MD-derived ensembles, enabling clustering and similarity trees that are often more function-relevant than sequence similarity. 

binding-site-vectors-enable-map…

Docking/pose triage at scale: generate candidate poses for many CYP–metabolite pairs, then prioritize using BSV-derived geometric/electrostatic compatibility (BSVs are not a direct ΔG binder, but provide a structured pocket/pose compatibility signal). 

binding-site-vectors-enable-map…

Ensemble-aware ranking: incorporate conformational diversity by weighting representative conformations (“exemplars”) and/or clustering ensembles (useful for flexible CYP pockets).

Conceptual background (method this integrates)
Binding site vectors (BSVs)

Vectors are generated by placing an icosahedron inside a sphere, subdividing faces, projecting vertices to the sphere, and extending rays from the sphere center toward those vertices; the sphere is then positioned at the binding-site center.

Per-vector comparisons enable high-resolution pocket similarity across proteins with similar backbones but different active-site chemistries.

Similarity metric (shape + charge)

Combined similarity is computed as a normalized RMSD over vector lengths and partial charges, with optional weighting to emphasize shape vs electrostatics.

binding-site-vectors-enable-map…

The paper reports separate normalization constants (σ) for human vs plant CYP datasets when analyzed independently (example values used in Case Study 1): σ_l = 3.833 Å and σ_q = 0.213 e for plant CYPs.

Trees and clustering (static + ensemble workflows)

Similarity trees can be built from: (i) phylogenetic sequence matrices (Clustal Omega), (ii) full-structure RMSD matrices (PyMOL cealign), and (iii) BSV RMSD matrices (BSVs). 

binding-site-vectors-enable-map…

Ensemble workflows weight RMSD contributions by how many trajectory frames each exemplar represents (N = 15,625 frames per simulation in the paper’s pipeline).

Cross-isoform conformational-state clustering can be performed with Affinity Propagation on BSV-derived RMSD matrices to identify shared “binding-site states” across enzymes.

Plant-specific considerations (as implemented here)

In the paper’s plant analysis, the dataset is large and structure availability is a major constraint (supporting figures focus on BSV-based trees over plant CYPs). 

kuvek_supp_2026

This repo is designed for plant CYPomes that are predominantly predicted structures (e.g., AlphaFold-class models), where functional inference must lean on pocket geometry/electrostatics + ensemble sampling rather than ligand-bound crystal structures.

Inputs

Protein structures: PDB/mmCIF (one per CYP), optionally ensembles (trajectory snapshots or clustered exemplars).

Protein sequences: FASTA (for phylogenetic comparison / naming sanity checks).

Metabolites/ligands: SMILES/SDF/MOL2 (SMILES are accepted but must be converted to 3D conformers for docking).

Docking poses (optional but recommended): predicted CYP–ligand complexes (PDB/SDF pose outputs) for pose triage.

Outputs

BSV descriptors per structure / per exemplar (shape + charge vectors).

Pairwise similarity matrices: sequence, backbone RMSD, BSV RMSD (shape / charge / combined).

Trees: phylogenetic vs full-structure vs BSV-based dendrograms.

Ensemble summaries: exemplar weights, cluster memberships, cross-isoform state overlaps. 

binding-site-vectors-enable-map…

CYP–metabolite ranking tables: per ligand, per CYP, ranked by (pose score, BSV compatibility, ensemble support).

Pipeline overview

Standardize structures

Ensure consistent residue/atom naming, protonation/charge model choice, and a reproducible alignment strategy across the CYPome.

Define binding-site center and BSV geometry

Use a binding-site center consistent across models (e.g., heme-centered coordinates when available; otherwise a reproducible proxy tied to conserved CYP geometry).

Generate BSV descriptors

Compute vector lengths and partial charges per direction; store descriptors for downstream comparisons. 

binding-site-vectors-enable-map…

Compute similarity matrices + trees

Sequence (Clustal Omega), backbone RMSD (PyMOL cealign), BSV RMSD (eq-based normalization/weighting), hierarchical clustering (SciPy average linkage). 

binding-site-vectors-enable-map…

(Optional) MD ensembles + exemplars

Subsample or cluster trajectories into exemplars; weight comparisons by exemplar populations (paper uses N=15,625 frames). 

binding-site-vectors-enable-map…

Batch docking and pose triage

Dock metabolites into CYPs; prioritize plausible CYP–metabolite pairs using BSV-based pocket/pose compatibility as an orthogonal filter to docking scores.

(Optional) Cross-isoform “state” discovery

Cluster exemplars across CYPs using Affinity Propagation on BSV RMSD to identify shared functional pocket states.

Relationship to existing pocket tools

The BSV approach was motivated by limits of conventional pocket descriptors for high-resolution comparative pocket similarity (the paper cites prior use of fpocket/mdpocket in dynamic pocket characterization but motivates BSVs for finer-grained comparison).

Scope and non-goals

Not intended to replace careful mechanistic enzymology or experimental validation.

BSV similarity is not a direct binding free-energy prediction; it is a structured descriptor to support functional grouping, candidate narrowing, and ensemble-aware compatibility assessment.
